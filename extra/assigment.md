Assigment # 2: Long Take

Begin 2/04, due in two weeks, 2/24

One continuous shot. No cuts, no break in action, real time.
2 minute maximum. What it’s all about:
-- Visual storytelling – using visuals and action only to tell a story.
-- Exploring expressive possibilities of a moving camera: vary the shot, make transitions between angles, use action to motivate changes, find creative ways to make it interesting
-- practice cinematography skills. Handholding: how steady and smooth can you be?

From syllabus:
Make a video that is one uninterrupted  shot. Think up a simple plot that can be told entirely through visual means, without dialogue. Reveal the plot within three minutes, using a camera in motion — tilting, panning, tracking, leading and following, moving in and out — revealing actions and reactions.

Best if you script or choreograph the Long Take in advance. Work out the story and progression of shots. Do a storyboard. Having a solid idea of what you are doing, a plan of action, will help you when it is time to shoot and you are dealing with too many things: focus, exposure, zooming, making camera moves, directing your subject, what do I do next?

Remember  the properties of different kinds of shots. Wide angle is going to work best because it has greatest depth of focus and minimizes camera motion, which is a problem when you handhold. You can also use it to exaggerate motion to and from camera. If you are in a busy place where
you lack control, it’s best to shoot wide angle and let the automatic controls deal with focus and exposure. The opposite, a telephoto or tight shot, is much harder to handhold, shows every but of camera motion, and depth of focus is shallow, unforgiving  of mistakes. Medium shots are in between: some depth of focus, motion can be pleasing if smooth, motion to and from camera is more like the eye sees it. Can pan and tilt to reveal things.

Point of view considerations. Camera can be subject of story, seeing what the character sees. Or camera can be objective, see the subject as the story is revealed. If you cannot find someone to be the on-camera subject, you will have to shoot a subjective POV piece.

Don’t do this:
-- wander around with nothing happening, no story
-- give us a garden tour
-- follow someone with a sword, revealing or changing nothing until the end
-- ride a bus with nothing happening for long intervals
-- phony attack or something that happens suddenly for no reason
-- your dog jumping to get treats

Remember that this is about visual storytelling. You have to think up a story. Don’t get sloppy and say, “Then a monster appears…” Make it real, give things a reason for happening. 
Get creative with your camera work. For instance, if it is a basketball game, get in close, put us inside the action, getting shoved about. Capture the blur, let the shot go abstract, become a whirl of color and light. Darker light makes the lens open up and the exposure longer; you can use that to make more expressive and mysterious shots. Think of ways
the camera can interact with the subject – maybe a kiss or a punch. Try a tilt up that starts
on feet and goes up to reveal face. Try circling around subject 360 degrees. Some ideas and examples:
-- war games, laser tag, with the camera a participant, stalking and being stalked.
-- looking for something lost, getting locked out, a comedy of errors
-- thief breaks into house – do they surprise someone? Or are they surprised?
-- a scary night out in the woods
-- fighting for what to watch on Netflix and making a deal
-- putting on a sari and makeup, mother and daughter.
-- Getting dressed and going out but not making it to the destination
-- Dancing with the camera
-- a game of chase. What could be simpler or more fun? Locations to consider:
-- Any place that is safe and allows for social distancing

-- If you work alone, consider using a tripod

-- Graveyard, gardens, walls, statues. nature
